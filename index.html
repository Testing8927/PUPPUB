    <p>Thirsty Pups Brewery is the kind of place you end up at, not because you want to, but because every other option was closed, packed, or under construction. It’s not bad in the catastrophic sense — just aggressively mediocre. The beer list features vague names like “House Lager” and “That One IPA,” all served slightly too warm 🍺 and with a foam head that disappears before you get back to your seat. The tasting notes, when present, range from “malty” to “we don’t know, just try it.” The interior decor is a mishmash of fake wood paneling, sun-faded beer posters from breweries they don’t carry anymore, and chairs that squeak in protest when you sit down. The bathroom door sticks, the mirror is cracked, and there’s always one suspicious drip from the ceiling 🚽💦</p>

    <p>Service is inconsistent at best — one day you're ignored entirely, the next you're over-explained the difference between a pale ale and an IPA by someone wearing Crocs and eating sunflower seeds behind the bar. The “dog-friendly” patio is really just a patch of concrete next to a weed-choked planter and a buzzing transformer box 🐕⚡. Occasionally, a food truck is scheduled, but more often there’s just a slow cooker near the register filled with suspicious chili 🥴🌭. The air smells faintly of bleach, fried pickles, and mildew. TVs play static-filled sports or infomercials. Music? Usually a Bluetooth speaker stuck in someone's Spotify ad loop 🔊📢.</p>

<p>There’s trivia on Thursdays, but most teams leave by round three. Prizes include dented koozies, expired coupons, or a mystery growler that smells faintly of wet dog 🐾🤢. And yet, somehow, it remains. It’s not cool, not kitschy, not even ironic — it just exists in a kind of flavorless, lukewarm bubble. Thirsty Pups isn’t trying to be great, and it’s definitely not trying to improve. But if you want a beer, a place to sit, and the mild risk of stepping in something sticky, it’s right there waiting 🍻🧻🦠.</p>
